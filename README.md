## Task

We created a test school with a course that contains 4 lecture.
Your task is to write tests where you enroll in a course and complete it.
We've setup Rspec and Cucumber in this repo.
Feel free to choose one that fits you the best, or use any other e2e testing framework.


## Setup

Install dependencies for Rspec or Cucumber if you choose to use one of them:
```
gem bundler install
```

```
bundle install
```
